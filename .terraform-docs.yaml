  # terraform-aws-kubernetes
  
  [![official JetBrains project](https://jb.gg/badges/official.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)
  
  This repository contains a Terraform Module that sets up a Kubernetes infrastructure on AWS using Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
  It provides flexibility in managing its own internal networking infrastructure or using an external one, and supports different types
  of node pools. The repository also includes guides for usage and contribution, automated tests, and examples for ready use.

  ## Compatibility

  The minimum supported Terraform version is: 1.3.0.
  
  ## Features
  
  * Configure Kubernetes cluster network with options for internal and external networking, VPC settings, subnetting, DNS, DHCP, ACLs, VPC tags and other.
  
  * Support both AWS-managed and self-managed compute pools, with detailed configurations for instance types, scaling, and labeling.
  
  * Specify IAM roles and policies for the Kubernetes cluster, service accounts, and encryption key management.
  
  * Include addons for the Kubernetes cluster such as CoreDNS, VPC CNI, kube-proxy, and more with conflict resolution strategies.
  
  * Provide detailed storage class configurations, including default classes and custom classes with parameters like encryption and volume binding modes.
  
  * Set up monitoring, logging, and autoscaling using Helm charts with configurable repository, chart versions, and values.
  
  * Provide means for adding custom configurations to the Kubernetes cluster, such as custom Helm charts, manifests, and scripts.
